# Breast-Cancer-Survival-Predictor 🎗️❤️
A machine learning project built to predict **Breast Cancer Mortality Status** and estimate **Survival Duration** using clinical and demographic data. This solution supports healthcare professionals with data-driven insights, aiding in the planning and personalization of patient care.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

Breast cancer survival prediction is a critical component of personalized medicine. This project tackles two core objectives:

1. **Classification Task**: Predict whether a patient is likely to survive (Alive vs. Dead).
2. **Regression Task**: Predict survival time in months for patients.

Real-world anonymized clinical data is used to train and evaluate machine learning models for both tasks.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC 
  - Regression: MAE, MSE, R²

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Accurate Predictions**: Leverages algorithms like Decision Trees and Logistic Regression for classification and regression tasks.
- 📈 **Feature Insights**: Identifies the most influential features contributing to survival outcomes.
- 🔍 **Overfitting Prevention**: Applies pruning techniques to improve generalization and model reliability.
